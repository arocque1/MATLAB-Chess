Chess in MATLAB! This is just a little side project I made while I was taking a class in MATLAB. 
The game functions as if you were playing on a physical board, so no cheating!

To run this code for yourself, simply create a folder on your desktop, and drag everything 
from the repository (except the .gitattributes) to that folder, and run the code!

I should note, the only feature this code is missing from real chess is the ability to 
promote a pawn to a queen when reaching the other side of the board, and en passant. Also,
as said earlier in the README, this code functions like a physical chessboard, so there is
no function to check if the king is checked or in checkmate, so that will be up to the user
to determine. There is also no restriction on where pieces can move so the user can move
any piece anywhere if they want, but where's the fun in that!
